            <p>Over the past 100 years, alot of areas in life have been revolutionized <br> but education is not one of them. Historically, higher education has <br> avoided competitive disruption. One reason for this past immunity is <br> the power of prestige in the higher education marketplace, where the <br> quality of the product is hard to measure. At Ubunifu Our focus is to <br> graduate all students innovation ready, ready to solve problems <br> creatively.</p>
